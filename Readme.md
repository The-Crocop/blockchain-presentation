How does it work:

Journalists in dangerous Regions have a  reporter app that allows them to create content and push it into the ethereum based journalist blockchain without exposing them.
(world map with Dangerous regions)


Users or Verlage can receive that content over a so called DAPP ()
Theycan rate the content and donate to the reporters. Since we are using anonymous addresses and smart contracts nobody can fake the ratings, or track the payments


The End Result:

Journalists can safely create objective high quallity journalist content in unsafe regions, even if it is themed against the government

The Bonus:
We could turn this around and fight fake new if needed.
Content Publisher publishes his public address on a safe channel and we have the proof thats only him ppublishing the content
